## What is ImpulseRC Driver Fixer?

**ImpulseRC Driver Fixer** is a dedicated utility that automatically detects, diagnoses, and repairs **USB/DFU/Bootloader** driver issues for **STM32**-based flight controllers. When Windows fails to recognize your board, picks the wrong driver, or COM ports vanish during flashing, the tool resolves conflicts and restores a clean, reliable connection to Betaflight, INAV, EmuFlight, and more.

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Auto-detection** of the board and proper mode selection (Normal/Bootloader/DFU).
- 🛠 **Driver repair** for STM32, WinUSB, Zadig-installed packages, and conflicting registry bindings.
- 🔄 **DFU switching** and safe reboots that prepare the board for flashing without losing profiles.
- 🧭 **COM conflict cleanup**: remove ghost devices, revive missing COM ports, and stabilize connections.
- 🧰 **Compatibility** with common USB-UART chipsets (CP210x, FTDI, CH340) and Microsoft drivers.
- 📡 **Configurator friendly**: restores connectivity to Betaflight/INAV/EmuFlight/BLHeli in minutes.
- 📋 **Operation logs** for support tickets and reproducible troubleshooting.
- 🧪 **Connection test**: validate enumeration, throughput, and board identity.
- 🧯 **Safe by design**: no firmware or user profile modifications, drivers only.

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🔍 Deep USB stack diagnostics: device classes, GUIDs, drivers, and power/suspend states.
- 🧹 Cleanup of leftover entries from failed installers and manual Zadig attempts.
- 🧭 Guided bootloader entry: BOOT button tips, jumpers, and hotkey hints.
- ⚙️ “Safe flashing” checklist before migrating to a new firmware version.
- 🧩 Preset profiles for popular boards: F3/F4/F7/H7 families and bootloader variants.
- 💬 Silent mode for service centers: unattended repair with a final summary report.

## Who Should Use It?

- FPV pilots and hobbyists facing DFU/COM detection issues.  
- Service technicians who need faster flashing and diagnostics.  
- Firmware testers and developers frequently switching boards/firmware.  
- Training labs and classrooms that must bring a rig online quickly.

## Getting Started

1. Install or update USB-to-serial drivers for your board if needed.  
2. Connect the flight controller via USB and close all configurators.  
3. Launch **ImpulseRC Driver Fixer** with administrator privileges.  
4. Click **Start** and wait for automatic device detection.  
5. Follow prompts to enter **Bootloader/DFU** when requested.  
6. Wait for confirmation that correct drivers were installed and bound.  
7. Open Betaflight/INAV and confirm a stable COM/DFU connection.

## Tips & Common Scenarios

- If the device appears/disappears rapidly in Device Manager, try a shorter cable and run Silent mode.  
- For “Unknown USB Device,” swap port/cable first, then run the fixer.  
- For boards with a BOOT button, hold it while plugging in USB to enter DFU.  
- After flashing, exit DFU by replugging USB or pressing Reset.  
- Keep logs for rare conflicts with corporate policies or endpoint security tools.
